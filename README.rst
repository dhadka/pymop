This framework provides a collection of test problems in Python. The main features are:

- Most important multi-objective test function is one place
- Vectorized evaluation by using numpy matrices (no for loops)
- Gradients and Hessian matrices are available through automatic differentiation
- Easily new problems can be created using custom classes or functions


Here, you can find a detailed documentation and information about the framework:
